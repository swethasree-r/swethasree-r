## 👋 About Me

I’m **SwethaSree R**, a final-year **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** undergraduate from **NIT Puducherry**, deeply interested in **power electronics, electric vehicles, battery management systems, and system-level modeling**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- ⚙️ **Theory-backed engineering**
- 🧠 **Simulation-driven design**
- 🔌 **Hardware-aware implementation**

I enjoy breaking complex energy systems into clean, testable models — especially using **MATLAB/Simulink** — and building solutions that are both **technically sound and practically deployable**.
